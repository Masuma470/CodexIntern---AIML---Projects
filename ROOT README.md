# 🚀 CODEXINTERN – August Internship Projects  

This repository contains the **3 projects** I completed as part of my **CODEXINTERN August Internship**.  
Each project is in its own folder with code, documentation, and additional resources (plots, models, data, or artifacts depending on the project).

## 📌 Projects  

1. [🌸 Iris Flower Classification](./Iris_Flower_Classification)  
   - Classified iris flowers into **Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica**.  
   - Used Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and SVM.  
   - Includes EDA, confusion matrices, and model comparison.  

2. [📧 Spam Mail Detector](./Spam_Mail_Detector)  
   - Classified emails as **Spam / Not Spam** using the **UCI Spambase dataset**.  
   - Logistic Regression model with preprocessing and saved scaler/model for deployment.  
   - Includes confusion matrix & class distribution plots.  

3. [🏡 California House Price Prediction](./HousePricePrediction)  
   - Predicted **median house values** in California districts.  
   - Compared Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and Random Forest regressors.  
   - Best model: Random Forest (R² = 0.798).  
   - Includes feature engineering, residual plots, and feature importance.
